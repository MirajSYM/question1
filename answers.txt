Question (a):

Here in the project the the information flow is determined by the state management.
By information flow what I meant is,changing infromation and making it accessible to other widget. 
Therefore, if we do not apply state management the widget might get stuck in one state.
meaning, the application will not be able to change (ie, from light mode to dark mode).

Question (b):

In this application the body is the state part. By changing the light to dark mode
we are just changing the state of the body. We are doing that by pressing the floating action 
button.

Question (c):

Declarative UI aproach helps the app to change UI without any compilation. 
Which helps the app to easily shift states.
In this application we are shifting to dark theme from light without any recopilation of the application. 
Also the color of the text shifts from one to another without the need of recopilation.
